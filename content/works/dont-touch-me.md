Humans are curious creatures by nature, always drawn toward the mysterious and the unknown. This attraction has been a subject of fascination through the ages, shaping our interactions and our understanding of the world around us.

Don't Touch Me stands as a reflection on the human condition, it captures a universal human experience - the balance between curiosity and self-preservation. It invites the audience to challenge the invisible forces that govern our interactions with the unknown, using the interplay of proximity and distance to evoke an understanding of our attraction to the unfamiliar and the potential consequences of coming too close.
