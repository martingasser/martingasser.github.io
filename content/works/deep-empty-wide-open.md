Collaboration with Valerie Messini.

The installation is based on an idea by Valerie Messini which is outlined [here](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1942520/1942434?c=0). In short, we use Generative Adversarial Networks (i.e., an architecture called [CycleGAN](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/)) to learn a mapping from pictures of humans to pictures of sea horizons in a semi-supervised way. In the live installation, live videos of visitors are then transformed into sea horizon images.

The resulting images/videos are somewhat reminiscent of impressionist paintings, and the installation invites visitors to interactively explore the generative capabilities of the algorithm with facial expressions and gestures.

Exhibited at [Artemis Gallery Lisbon](https://www.artemis-gallery.net/) in the exhibition [Beyond Human](https://www.artemis-gallery.net/exhibition/beyond-human/). 

<!-- As a side note: I was not credited by the gallery (because I joined the project after it was initially pitched). This is unfortunate, but an important learning for me. -->
