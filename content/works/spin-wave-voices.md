We are in a search of alternative ways of living, more efficient, less energy consuming ways. But some of the modern technologies are so small and fast that they are already out of the range of our perception. The future will bring something even more sophisticated. Did you ever try to imagine how all those gigabytes and billions of gigabytes of information are processed and transferred around the world so quickly? Researchers are already working on alternative, faster, more efficient way of doing that as well. With this exhibit we did our best to bring you closer to the possible future of computational technologies.
