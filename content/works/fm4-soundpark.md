We present an application of content-based music recommendation techniques within an online community platform
targeted at an audience interested mainly in independent and
alternative music. The web platformâ€™s goals will be described, the problems of content management approaches
based on daily publishing of new music tracks will be discussed, and we will give an overview of the user interfaces
that have been developed to simplify access to the music
collection. Finally, the adoption of content-based music recommendation tools and new user interfaces to improve user
acceptance and recommendation quality will be justified by
detailed user access analyses.
