For the [Co-Corporeality](https://cocorporeality.net/) artistic research project, we have developed a mobile eye tracking solution. It consists of a [Pupil Labs](https://pupil-labs.com/) eye camera, an [Intel Realsense T265](https://www.intelrealsense.com/tracking-camera-t265/) tracking camera, and an [Intel Realsense D435](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435/) world camera, mounted on a bike helmet. A [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) is used to compress and transmit the image data over Ethernet to another computer where a combination of the Pupil Labs software and custom software components is used to determine the exact position and gaze direction of a viewer in space. This information can be subsequently used to detect which objects a person currently looks at.
