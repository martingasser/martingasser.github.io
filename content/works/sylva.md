For the [2021 Princess of Asturias Awards](https://www.fpa.es/en/princess-of-asturias-awards/), I collaborated with the Viennese Design Studio [MAEID](https://maeid.com/), [Andrea Reni](https://andreareni.com/), [Lorem](http://www.lorem.parts/), [ABB](https://global.abb/group/en), and [CAMFED](https://camfed.org/eur/).

We built a robotic gardener that nurtured a landscape with grass seeds and water. The nurturing system was mounted on two industry robots and controlled by an AI-based computer vision system, and its actions were also influenced by data that was collected by [CAMFED](https://camfed.org/eur/) over the last 15 years.

See [this article](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/es/events/princesa-de-asturias) and the video below for more information.
