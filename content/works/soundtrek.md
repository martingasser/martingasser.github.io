The interactive installation Soundtrek provides an alternative acoustic reality for the urban walks of Klangmanifeste 2021. Just go to the Soundtrek page of the Klangmanifeste website on your smartphone, plug your earbuds in, and there we go: A generative sound composition that adapts to your surroundings. Big roads sound different than quiet side streets. Parks have a different sonic atmosphere than crowded market places. Soundtrek translates the changing moods of different urban places into music. The web based sound installation uses your geoposition to dynamically adapt to your environment. An invitation to experience a walk trought the neighbourhood in a completely new way. Augmented reality for your ears. And who knows, perhaps you will even discover some hidden acoustic easter eggs ;-).
