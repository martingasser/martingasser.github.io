Instant Choir is a participative performance, involving audience members as protagonists who are controlled by a smartphone app. It touches critical issues such as the manipulative power of technology, its effects on interpersonal communication and behavior, and the addictive potential of Social Media and recommender systems.

I developed smartphone apps (Android & iOS) and built a Max/MSP-based system for controlling stage visuals, audio, and smartphone apps from an on-stage iPad.
