People in love with each other claim to exhibit the "same heartbeat". The installation "HeartBeat" aims at detecting biological similarities among the ECG signals generated by two individuals, and by involving a complex mathematical model for similarity analysis. The degree of correspondence is used to express heartbeat harmony as a musical intonation, and to steer a large-format visualization. Out of pre-recorded heartbeats, visitors can find people "matching" their own heartbeat.

Exhibited at Ars Electronic 2005.
