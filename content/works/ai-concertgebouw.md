In this paper we present a real-world application (the first of its kind) of
machine listening in the context of a live concert in a world-famous concert
hall – the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. A real-time music tracking algorithm
listens to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra performing Richard Strauss’
Alpensinfonie and follows the progress in the sheet music, i.e., continuously
tracks the most likely position of the live music in the printed score.
This information, in turn, is used to enrich the concert experience for
members of the audience by streaming synchronised visual content
(the sheet music, explanatory text and videos) onto tablet computers
in the concert hall. The main focus of this paper is on the challenges
involved in tracking live orchestral music, i.e., how to deal with heavily
polyphonic music, how to prepare the data needed, and how to achieve the
necessary robustness and precision.
