As a follow-up to [Deep Empty - Wide Open](/works/deep-empty-wide-open), we realized a video installation as part of the [Other Island 3](https://www.instagram.com/theotherisland2024/) collaborative exhibition event in Vienna/Austria. The projection screens were located in the entrance foyer of the exhibition; we showed real sea footage and the what a CycleGAN algorithm trained on facial video recordings of the artists and sea footage generates from the sea videos. In order to point out the cross-domain character of the work, we also added the sound of the sea video recordings as ambience.
