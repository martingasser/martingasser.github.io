With Amadeus Acoustics, I developed highly optimized C++-based Max/MSP externals (interpolating delay matrix, eq, compressor) for a low-latency multi-channel live spatialization system running on commodity PC hardware. Furthermore, I conceptualized and implemented a web-based remote control surface for the system.
