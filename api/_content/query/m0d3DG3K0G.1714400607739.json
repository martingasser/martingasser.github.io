It explores the relationship among natural elements, technology, and living systems favoring the creation of an ecology of non-human subjects. It is a built habitat that can restore and nurture itself, redefining the role of living systems in architecture.It is a performative 3D-printed soil robotic garden. Sensors respond and machine learning creates continuous feedback among sensing, virtualizing, and induced change. Its inhabitable space combines visual, auditory, olfactory, and haptic features to capture the sensual experience of this new, mediated form of nature. Nothing in it could exist without the presence of the other: interconnectivity in biological entities. Fungal flora and soil structure depend on the robot to nurture them; the robot relies on their existence to move. The interconnectivity and performativity of all elements generates ambient sound and a visual interface uncovers the otherwise invisible stream of impact and growth."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"div","props":{"className":["video-container"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tag":"iframe","props":{"src":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQReQhF4Gvc","className":["video"],"title":"YouTube video player","frameBorder":"0","allow":"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture","allowFullScreen":true},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It was exhibited at the "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/2021/among-diverse-beings/maeid-b%C3%BCro-f%C3%BCr-architektur-und-transmediale-kunst","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Biennale Architettura 2021"}]},{"type":"text","value":"."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Collaborators:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://maeid.com/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"MAEID"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://medienmanufaktur.com/musikerinnen/lukaslauermann-2/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Lukas Lauermann"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://andreareni.com/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Andrea Reni"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.lorem.parts","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Francesco D'Abbraccio"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.lucapagan.info/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Luca Pagan"}]}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:works:magicqueen.md","_source":"content","_file":"works/magicqueen.md","_extension":"md"}
