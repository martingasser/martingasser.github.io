Furthermore, we describe two real-world applications that involve the work presented here. Firstly, our web applications are used in the editorial stage of a periodically released subscription-based mobile app by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (RCO) 1 , which serves as a contentdistribution channel for multi-modally enhanced recordings of classical concerts. Secondly, our web API and user interfaces have been successfully used to provide real-time information (such as the score, and explanatory comments from musicologists) to the audience during a live concert of the RCO."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"collaborators:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.andreas-arzt.com/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Andreas Arzt"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/about-us/people/harald-frostel/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Harald Frostel"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.jku.at/institut-fuer-computational-perception/ueber-uns/mitarbeiterinnen/thassilo-gadermaier/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Thassilo Gadermaier"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://maarten.grachten.eu/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Maarten Grachten"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/about-us/people/gerhard-widmer/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Gerhard Widmer"}]}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:works:classical-music-web.md","_source":"content","_file":"works/classical-music-web.md","_extension":"md"}
