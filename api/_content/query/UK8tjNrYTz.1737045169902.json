The piezo is connected to a ESP32 microcontroller with a Bluetooth LE connection to a laptop running Max/MSP and Ableton Live. Max/MSP takes care of receiving the trigger signals via BLE. The parts of the composition are laid out in Ableton Live as scenes that can be triggered via MIDI by the Max/MSP patch. The Max/MSP patch also controls DMX lighting. A 2x 500W audio system plus subwoofer is used to render the soundscape."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It was exhibited from 28.-30.
