The installation \"HeartBeat\" aims at detecting biological similarities among the ECG signals generated by two individuals, and by involving a complex mathematical model for similarity analysis. The degree of correspondence is used to express heartbeat harmony as a musical intonation, and to steer a large-format visualization.
