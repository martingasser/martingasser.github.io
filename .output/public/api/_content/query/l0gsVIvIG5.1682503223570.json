A real-time music tracking algorithm\nlistens to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra performing Richard Strauss’\nAlpensinfonie and follows the progress in the sheet music, i.e., continuously\ntracks the most likely position of the live music in the printed score.\nThis information, in turn, is used to enrich the concert experience for\nmembers of the audience by streaming synchronised visual content\n(the sheet music, explanatory text and videos) onto tablet computers\nin the concert hall. The main focus of this paper is on the challenges\ninvolved in tracking live orchestral music, i.e., how to deal with heavily\npolyphonic music, how to prepare the data needed, and how to achieve the\nnecessary robustness and precision."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"collaborators:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.andreas-arzt.com/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Andreas Arzt"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/about-us/people/harald-frostel/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Harald Frostel"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.jku.at/institut-fuer-computational-perception/ueber-uns/mitarbeiterinnen/thassilo-gadermaier/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Thassilo Gadermaier"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://maarten.grachten.eu/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Maarten Grachten"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/about-us/people/gerhard-widmer/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Gerhard Widmer"}]}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:works:ai-concertgebouw.md","_source":"content","_file":"works/ai-concertgebouw.md","_extension":"md"}
