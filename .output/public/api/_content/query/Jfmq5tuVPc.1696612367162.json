The background stories behind a piece, and the way it is perceived by different types of audiences. Through smart use of technology, we want to use this richness to build a whole new classical concert experience. A concert experience that can guide you through a performance, with information tailored to varying expertise levels. A concert experience that allows you to get an impression of a piece before a concert, enriches the experience during a concert, and lets you revisit the concert after it was played, allowing you to discover new things about it. A concert experience that even may initiate a social discussion based on your impressions and the impressions of other attendees.
